*GraphsJ - Example scenarios*


## Introduction

This project provides an example scenario - *Prim's Shortest Spanning Tree* - showing how to easily implement custom scenarios using the latest version of the [GraphsJ Scenario Development Kit](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ-sdk) and the [EighthBridge](https://github.com/giancosta86/EighthBridge) toolkit.


## Installation

Download the binary JAR file from the [release](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ-scenarios/releases/latest) section, then copy it to [GraphsJ](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ)'s scenarios directory to automatically make it available within the program - with no restart required.
