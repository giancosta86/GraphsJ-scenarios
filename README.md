*GraphsJ - Example scenarios*


## Introduction

**GraphsJ - Scenarios** provides ready-made scenarios to solve problems in the domains of *Operations Research* and *Artificial Intelligence*.

Apart from their didactic value, these examples can show you how to easily create custom scenarios using the [GraphsJ Scenario Development Kit](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ-sdk) and its dependencies - especially  [LambdaPrism](https://github.com/giancosta86/LambdaPrism) for Artificial Intelligence and [EighthBridge](https://github.com/giancosta86/EighthBridge) for graph modeling and rendering.


## Installation

The recommended way to install this project is:

0. Run GraphsJ

0. Choose *Settings -> Install predefined scenarios*
